## Overview

One-hour demo/discussoin about popular open-source tools for efficient scientific workflows.

The strongest driver of human behaviour environment. By shaping your environment you can increase the odds that you will display the behaviour that you want. Luckily, the key behaviours that determine your success are relatively few. 

These two things will help you maximize your success:

1. Identify key behaviour. 
2. Shape your environment to enforce those behaviours. 

Now, say that you want to eat healthier. Which behaviour may help you achieve your goal more effectively?

1. Resist the icecream every time you open your refrigerator.
2. Avoid buying icecream.
