# workflow

Materials for a one-hour seminar about popular open-source tools for efficient scientific workflows.

* [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GtAW9t6A6zcEpIQvCaylcFpQkbjNgWjz7XYotHL9gbs/edit?usp=sharing) to demonstrate features that are great for scientific data collection. The dataset contains links to potentially useful resources -- including books, websites, articles, and videos.

## Idea

Why airplanes crash so infrequently?

a. Because the pilots err almost never.
b. Because airplances were designed to make common errors almost impossible.

The strongest driver of human behaviour environment. By shaping your environment you can increase the odds that you will display the behaviour that you want. Luckily, the key behaviours that determine your success are relatively few. 

Two things will help you makimize your success:

1. Identify key behaviour. 
2. Shape your environment to enforce those behaviours.

Now, say that you want to eat healthier. Which behaviour may help you achieve your goal more effectively?

1. Resist the icecream every time you open your refrigerator.
2. Avoid buying icecream.

## What to show and discuss

I'll show how popular, open-source tools can help you create a safe work environment that, by protecting you from common error, will smoothen your workflow and easier lead to success.

To give everyone a voice in our discussions I'll likely use https://todaysmeet.com/.

## Toolkit

These are some tools that I'm considering.

Software tools:

* Google sheets
* rstudio.cloud
* publishing services
* using R-packages
  * __tidyverse__
  * rmarkdown documents
* data R-packages
* project R-packags

Cognitive tools:

* Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard (book by Dan Heath, Chip Heath).
* The Habits Guide: How to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones (book by James Clear).
